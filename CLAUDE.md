fetch-router is a composable HTTP router library for the Fetch API, built with TypeScript.

the source code is organized under `src/`:

- `lib/`: core router implementation (router, middleware, routes, injection, controllers)
- `lib/route-helpers/`: convenience helpers for common route patterns (method, form, resource)
- `middlewares/`: optional middleware exports (async-context)

## development notes

### project management

- tools like Node.js, Bun and pnpm are managed by mise, to run them, use `mise exec -- pnpm ...`
- build with `pnpm run build` (uses tsdown)
- typecheck with `pnpm run typecheck`
- format with `pnpm run fmt` (uses prettier)
- lint with `pnpm run lint` (uses oxlint)
- check `pnpm view <package>` before adding a new dependency

### code writing

- new files should be in kebab-case
- use tabs for indentation, spaces allowed for diagrams in comments
- use single quotes and add trailing commas
- prefer arrow functions, but use regular methods in classes unless arrow functions are necessary
  (e.g., when passing the method as a callback that needs `this` binding)
- use braces for control statements, even single-line bodies
- use bare blocks `{ }` to group related code and limit variable scope
- use template literals for user-facing strings and error messages
- use `// #region <name>` and `// #endregion` to denote regions when a file needs to contain a lot
  of code

### documentation

- documentations include README, code comments, commit messages
- any writing should be in lowercase, except for proper nouns, acronyms and 'I'
- only comment non-trivial code, focusing on _why_ rather than _what_
- write comments and JSDoc in lowercase (except proper nouns, acronyms, and 'I')
- add JSDoc comments to new publicly exported functions, methods, classes, fields, and enums
- JSDoc should include proper annotations:
  - use `@param` for parameters (no dashes after param names)
  - use `@returns` for return values
  - use `@throws` for exceptions when applicable
  - keep descriptions concise but informative

### testing

- Bun is the test runner
- run tests via `mise exec -- bun test`

### working style

- `.research/` directory in the project root serves as a workspace for temporary experiments,
  analysis, and planning materials. create if not present (it's gitignored). this directory may
  contain cloned repositories or other reference materials that can help inform implementation
  decisions
- this document is intentionally incomplete; discover everything else in the repo
- don't make assumptions or speculate about code, plans, or requirements without exploring first;
  pause and ask for clarification when you're still unsure after looking into it
- in plan mode, present the plan for review before exiting to allow for feedback or follow-up
  questions

### Claude Code-specific

- Bash tool persists directory changes (`cd`) across calls; always specify cd with absolute paths to
  be sure
- Task tool (subagents for exploration, planning, etc.) may not always be accurate; verify subagent
  findings when needed
